VIDEO INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename: Unknown
Path: Unknown
Duration: 0.00 seconds
Resolution: Unknown
Frame Rate: 0.00 fps
Codec: Unknown
File Size: 0.00 MB

DETECTION RESULTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Classification: UNCERTAIN
Confidence Level: 50%
Frames Analyzed: 10
Sampling Strategy: uniform

FRAME-LEVEL OBSERVATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Frame 0:
  - Moderate texture variance (some smoothing possible)
  - Low edge density (possible boundary blending)
Frame 1:
  - Moderate texture variance (some smoothing possible)
  - Low edge density (possible boundary blending)
Frame 3:
  - Moderate texture variance (some smoothing possible)
  - Low edge density (possible boundary blending)
Frame 6:
  - Moderate texture variance (some smoothing possible)
  - Low edge density (possible boundary blending)
Frame 9:
  - Moderate texture variance (some smoothing possible)
  - Low edge density (possible boundary blending)

TEMPORAL OBSERVATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Temporal analysis across 10 frames:
  - Very low motion between frames 0 and 1 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Very low motion between frames 1 and 2 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Very low motion between frames 2 and 3 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Very low motion between frames 3 and 4 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Very low motion between frames 4 and 5 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Very low motion between frames 5 and 6 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Very low motion between frames 6 and 7 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Very low motion between frames 7 and 8 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Very low motion between frames 8 and 9 (potentially static/frozen)


FINAL REASONING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Classification: UNCERTAIN (Confidence: 50%)

The analysis reveals mixed signals, making confident classification difficult.

KEY EVIDENCE:
  - Very low motion between frames 2 and 3 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Low edge density (possible boundary blending)
  - Very low motion between frames 3 and 4 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Very low motion between frames 4 and 5 (potentially static/frozen)
  - Very low motion between frames 0 and 1 (potentially static/frozen)

ANALYSIS BREAKDOWN:
  - Visual Artifacts: 5 indicators detected
  - Temporal Consistency: 9 issues identified
  - Frames Analyzed: 5
  - Combined Suspicion Score: 0.52/1.00

CONCLUSION:
The evidence is inconclusive. Some artifacts are present, but they could potentially be attributed to video compression, lighting conditions, or other non-malicious factors. Further analysis or higher-quality source material would be needed for confident classification.
