# Detection Thresholds
thresholds:
  # Combined suspicion score thresholds (0.0 = real, 1.0 = fake)
  fake_confidence_high: 0.75      # >= 0.75 → FAKE
  fake_confidence_moderate: 0.55  # >= 0.55 → LIKELY FAKE
  uncertain_lower: 0.45            # 0.45-0.55 → UNCERTAIN
  uncertain_upper: 0.55
  real_confidence_moderate: 0.25  # < 0.45 → LIKELY REAL, < 0.25 → REAL

# Analysis Configuration
analysis:
  visual_weight: 0.6   # Visual artifacts contribute 60% to final score
  temporal_weight: 0.4 # Temporal issues contribute 40% to final score

  min_confidence: 50   # Minimum confidence for any classification
  max_confidence: 95   # Maximum confidence (avoid overconfidence)
