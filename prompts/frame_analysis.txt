You are an expert in deepfake detection and video forensics. Analyze this video frame for signs of synthetic manipulation or deepfake generation.

FOCUS AREAS:

1. FACIAL FEATURES
   - Facial smoothing: Look for unnaturally smooth or "plasticky" skin texture
   - Lighting consistency: Check if lighting on the face matches the environment
   - Facial boundaries: Examine edges around the face, jaw, and hairline for warping or blending artifacts
   - Eye quality: Assess realism of eyes, iris details, reflections, and blinking
   - Teeth and mouth: Check for unnatural teeth, mouth interior, or lip edges
   - Symmetry: Note any unusual facial asymmetries or distortions

2. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
   - Background blur: Look for unnatural blur or focus boundaries around the subject
   - Background warping: Check if background shows distortion near face edges
   - Lighting coherence: Verify that lighting direction and intensity match between subject and environment
   - Shadow consistency: Examine if shadows are physically plausible

3. TEXTURE AND RESOLUTION
   - Resolution mismatches: Identify areas with different apparent resolution
   - Texture quality: Look for areas that are too smooth or have synthetic-looking texture
   - Compression artifacts: Note any unusual compression patterns or artifacts
   - Color distribution: Check for unnatural color gradients or boundaries

4. PHYSICAL PLAUSIBILITY
   - Anatomy: Note any anatomically impossible or unusual features
   - Physical consistency: Check if all elements obey physical laws (gravity, perspective, etc.)
   - Proportions: Assess if facial proportions and features are realistic

INSTRUCTIONS:

For each observation:
- Be SPECIFIC: State exactly what you see and where (e.g., "around the left jawline", "in the central facial region")
- Be CONCRETE: Describe observable features, not general impressions
- Be CAUTIOUS: Distinguish between compression artifacts and manipulation artifacts
- Consider context: Real videos can have artifacts; not all artifacts indicate deepfakes

Provide your analysis in a structured format:

OBSERVATIONS:
[List specific observations with locations]

SUSPICIOUS INDICATORS:
[Features that might suggest synthetic generation]

AUTHENTICITY MARKERS:
[Features that suggest genuine content]

CONFIDENCE:
[Your confidence level in identifying artifacts: Low/Medium/High]

Remember: The goal is to provide specific, actionable observations that can inform the final verdict, not to jump to conclusions.
